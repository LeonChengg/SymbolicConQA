      "<p>Once your agency decides you can adopt, they\u2019ll begin the process of finding a child. The agency will explain how the process works and how you can be involved.</p>",
      "<p>If you live in Wales your agency can refer you to the National Adoption Service for Wales. This holds details of children across Wales who need adopting.</p>",
      "<h2>If an adoption agency says you cannot adopt</h2>",
      "<p>If you disagree with an adoption agency\u2019s decision, you can either:</p>",
      "<li>challenge their decision by writing to them</li>",
      "<li>apply to the Independent Review Mechanism, which will look into your case</li>",
      "<p>You can also contact other adoption agencies - but you\u2019ll have to start the process again.</p>",
      "<h1>Applying for an adoption court order</h1>",
      "<p>To make an adoption legal, you need to apply for an adoption court order. This gives you parental rights and responsibilities for the child.</p>",
      "<p>The child must have lived with you for at least 10 weeks before you apply.</p>",
      "<p>Once the order has been granted:</p>",
      "<li>the adoption becomes permanent</li>",
      "<li>the child has the same rights as if they were your own birth child, for example the right of inheritance</li>",
      "<li>you can buy a copy of the adoption certificate - you will not get this automatically</li>",
      "<p>The order also takes away parental responsibility from:</p>",
      "<li>the child\u2019s birth parent(s)</li>",
      "<li>anyone else who has parental responsibility for the child</li>",
      "<h2>How to apply</h2>",
      "<p>Most applications for adoption orders are done at a Family Court.</p>",
      "<p>You need to send the court a completed application for an adoption order - Form A58.</p>",
      "<h2>Getting an adoption certificate</h2>",
      "<p>If your application is successful, the General Register Office will create an adoption certificate. This replaces the original birth certificate, and shows the child\u2019s new name.</p>",
      "<p>If you want a copy of the new certificate you need to buy one - you will not get it automatically.</p>",
      "<p>A \u2018full\u2019 copy of the certificate costs \u00a311. You can order one:</p>",
      "<li>online</li>",
      "<li>by post</li>",
      "<p>You need the full version for most legal tasks for your child, for example getting a passport.</p>",
      "<h2>Adopting a child you\u2019ve been fostering</h2>",
      "<p>You need to be reassessed and approved as adoptive parents if you want to adopt the child you\u2019ve been fostering.</p>",
      "<h1>Adopting a stepchild</h1>",
      "<p>You need to tell your local council if you want to adopt your spouse\u2019s or partner\u2019s child. You must do this at least 3 months before applying to a court for an adoption order.</p>",
      "<p>The child must also have lived with both of you for at least 6 months.</p>",
      "<h2>The adoption assessment</h2>",
      "<p>The process to adopt is similar to an assessment through an adoption agency.</p>",
      "<p>The assessment is used to help a court decide if you can adopt the child (rather than being sent to an independent adoption panel).</p>",
      "<p>The court will ask your local council to provide a report on:</p>",
      "<li>your partner</li>",
      "<li>the child</li>",
      "<li>the other birth parent</li>",
      "<p>The report will be prepared by a social worker and will be used to help the court make a decision.</p>",
      "<p>If granted, the adoption court order gives you parental responsibility for the child - along with your spouse or partner.</p>",
      "<p>The order also takes away parental responsibility from:</p>",
      "<li>the child\u2019s other birth parent</li>",
      "<li>anyone else who has parental responsibility for the child</li>",
      "<p>An adoption order cancels any other type of court order, such as how and when the child\u2019s birth parent can visit the child.</p>",
      "<h1>Adopting a child from overseas</h1>",
      "<p>You can adopt a child from overseas if:</p>",
      "<li>they cannot be cared for in a safe environment in their own country</li>",
      "<li>the adoption would be in their best interests</li>",
      "<li>the adopter has been assessed as eligible and suitable to adopt from overseas by an adoption agency in the UK</li>",
      "<p>If you want to adopt a child from overseas, you should contact a UK adoption agency through:</p>",
      "<li>your local council in England and Wales</li>",
      "<li>your local health and social care trust in Northern Ireland</li>",
      "<li>a voluntary adoption agency that deals with overseas adoption</li>",
      "<p>There is a different process for overseas adoption in Scotland.</p>",
      "<p>The adoption process is similar to a UK adoption and will be done by a UK adoption agency that may charge a fee.</p>",
      "<p>If you\u2019re assessed and approved as suitable to adopt a child by a UK adoption agency, they will let you know what you need to do and guide you through these steps.</p>",
      "<li>Your application will be sent to the Department for Education (DfE) or your relevant UK Central Authority to check it meets eligibility criteria.</li>",
      "<li>DfE or your relevant UK Central Authority will issue a Certificate of Eligibility to Adopt and send it with your adoption application to the relevant overseas authority \u2013 some countries require adoption applications and supporting documentation is notarised, legalised and translated.</li>",
      "<li>Once matched, you need to visit the child in their own country and confirm in writing that you\u2019ve visited them and want to proceed with the adoption.</li>",
      "<li>You may need to go through adoption court processes in the country you\u2019re adopting from and the UK.</li>",
      "<li>Once the placement has been finalised, you will need to arrange entry clearance for the child to enter the UK.</li>",
      "<h2>Fees</h2>",
      "<p>The DfE charges a non-refundable fee of \u00a31,975 for processing an application to adopt a child from overseas. The fee is exempt from VAT.</p>",
      "<p>You\u2019ll be contacted by DfE about how to pay the fee once your application has been accepted.</p>",
      "<p>The fee includes case management but does not include legalisation, notarisation or translation costs.</p>",
      "<p>Contact the relevant authority to find out about fees and procedures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>",
      "<h2>Restrictions</h2>",
      "<p>The UK has restricted adoption from the following countries:</p>",
      "<li>Cambodia</li>",
      "<li>Guatemala</li>",
      "<li>Nepal</li>",
      "<li>Haiti</li>",
      "<li>Ethiopia</li>",
      "<li>Nigeria</li>",
      "<p>You can read about the reasons for the restrictions for each country.</p>",
      "<h3>How to make an exception request</h3>",
      "<p>If you want to adopt a child from a restricted country, you will need to set out the reasons in writing why your case is exceptional (for example, adopting a family member) and provide supporting evidence. Find out how to make an exception request to adopt a child from a country on the restricted list.</p>",
      "<p>You\u2019ll need to follow a different process for dealing with restricted countries in Scotland. Contact the Scottish Government for enquiries about restrictions in Scotland.</p>",
      "<h2>If you live abroad</h2>",
      "<p>You must follow the adoption laws of the country you\u2019re in if you\u2019re normally resident in that country and want to adopt.</p>",
      "<p>You must follow UK adoption law if you\u2019re normally resident in the UK, the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands. This is sometimes called \u2018habitual residence\u2019 and can apply even if you\u2019re living abroad at the time of the adoption. If you\u2019re unsure of your residence status, you should get your own independent legal advice before proceeding with an adoption.</p>",
      "<p>You may have to give a sworn statement in front of a solicitor that you\u2019re no longer habitually resident in the UK, the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands if the country asks for a \u2018no objection\u2019 letter from the UK government. You must send this statement, along with a copy of your passport, either to the Intercountry Adoption Team at the DfE or the nearest British embassy.</p>",
      "<p>If you\u2019ve adopted a child \u2013 either in the UK or overseas - and then travel or move to a third country, the adoption may not be recognised in that country. If you have any doubts you should get independent legal advice.</p>",
      "<h2>Registering an adoption</h2>",
      "<p>You can apply to register an overseas adoption in the Adopted Child Register for England and Wales if:</p>",
      "<li>the adoption took place in certain overseas countries</li>",
      "<li>the parent or parents were habitually resident in England and Wales at the time of the adoption</li>",
      "<li>the parent or parents can provide all the supporting documents</li>",
      "<p>You should read the guidance notes before filling in the form to register with the General Register Office (GRO).</p>",
      "<h1>Birth parents: your rights</h1>",
      "<p>For another couple (or person) to adopt your child, you normally have to agree to it.</p>",
      "<p>Once your child is adopted, you no longer have parental responsibility for them.</p>",
      "<p>Depending on the child\u2019s situation, you may be able to stay in contact with them. This is often done using letters and photographs (and sometimes meetings) through the agency responsible for arranging the adoption.</p>",
      "<h2>Fathers\u2019 rights</h2>",
      "<p>As the child\u2019s father you\u2019ll be asked to agree to the adoption - but only if you have parental responsibility.</p>",
      "<p>If you were never married to the child\u2019s mother or named on the birth certificate, you can apply to the court for a Parental Responsibility Order to get parental responsibility.</p>",
      "<h2>Trying to stop the adoption process</h2>",
      "<p>If the adoption process has started, you should get legal advice from a solicitor or Citizens Advice.</p>",
      "<p>To make an adoption legal, a court has to grant a court order.</p>",
      "<p>The agency arranging the adoption must let you know what your rights are - and also at what point the adoption cannot be stopped.</p>",
      "<p>If you do not want your child to be adopted, a court will give you the chance to say why. A social worker, independent of the adoption agency, will visit you and:</p>",
      "<li>record the reasons you do not want your child adopted</li>",
      "<li>let the court know these reasons - you can go to court to explain them</li>",
      "<p>An adoption order cannot be made unless the court thinks it\u2019s in your child\u2019s best interests.</p>",
      "<h2>Adoption without your consent</h2>",
      "<p>A court can decide the adoption can go ahead without your consent if:</p>",
      "<li>it thinks the child would be put at risk if they were not adopted - it will send you the evidence they have been given, for example from social services</li>",
      "<li>you\u2019re incapable of giving consent, for example due to a mental disability</li>"
