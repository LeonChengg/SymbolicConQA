            "<li>If you and the agency agree to carry on, the agency will give you an application form.</li>",

            "<p>The assessment is used to help a court decide if you can adopt the child (rather than being sent to an independent adoption panel).</p>",

            "<li>the other birth parent</li>",

            "<h2>Fees</h2>",

Find out how to make an exception request to adopt a child from a country on the restricted list.</p>",
            "<p>You’ll need to follow a different process for dealing with restricted countries in Scotland. Contact the Scottish Government for enquiries about restrictions in Scotland.</p>",
            "<h2>If you live abroad</h2>",
            "<p>You must follow the adoption laws of the country you’re in if you’re normally resident in that country and want to adopt.</p>",
            "<p>You must follow UK adoption law if you’re normally resident in the UK, the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands. This is sometimes called ‘habitual residence’ and can apply even if you’re living abroad at the time of the adoption. If you’re unsure of your residence status, you should get your own independent legal advice before proceeding with an adoption.</p>",
            "<p>You may have to give a sworn statement in front of a solicitor that you’re no longer habitually resident in the UK, the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands if the country asks for a ‘no objection’ letter from the UK government. You must send this statement, along with a copy of your passport, either to the Intercountry Adoption Team at the DfE or the nearest British embassy.</p>",
            "<p>If you’ve adopted a child – either in the UK or overseas - and then travel or move to a third country, the adoption may not be recognised in that country. If you have any doubts you should get independent legal advice.</p>",

            "<p>Depending on the child’s situation, you may be able to stay in contact with them. This is often done using letters and photographs (and sometimes meetings) through the agency responsible for arranging the adoption.</p>",
            "<h2>Fathers’ rights</h2>",
            "<p>As the child’s father you’ll be asked to agree to the adoption - but only if you have parental responsibility.</p>",
